README - Project on Rhs Core Domain Analysis
Project Overview - This project focuses on the identification and characterization of Rhs core domains in bacterial genomes from Apibacter, Frischella, Gilliamella, and Snodgrassella, as well as in five metagenomes extracted from published studies (links provided below). The primary goal is to identify potential Rhs toxins by leveraging HMMER profiles and bioinformatic pipelines.

The workflow is divided into six sequential scripts, each corresponding to a key step in the analysis pipeline.

Step 1: HMMER Search on Reference Genomes - Run HMMER searches on the protein sequences of reference genomes using the TIG_HMM_PROFILE, which is specific to Rhs core domains.This step identifies candidate sequences containing the Rhs core domain.
Step 2: Filtering HMMER Hits - Extract hits from the HMMER results with an e-value threshold of â‰¤ 1e-15 for further analysis.
Step 3: Alignment of Filtered Hit Sequences - Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for the filtered sequences from each genome separately. This step ensures that conserved regions are identified and helps in building high-quality profiles.
Step 4: Building HMMER Profiles - Generate HMM profiles from the alignments created in Step 3 for each genome. These profiles represent genome-specific Rhs domain patterns.
Step 5: Combining HMM Profiles - Combine the initial TIG_HMM_PROFILE with the genome-specific HMM profiles generated in Step 4. The result is a comprehensive "Rhs-core-database profile" that integrates information from all reference genomes.
Step 6: HMMER Search on Metagenomes - Use the combined Rhs-core-database profile to perform HMMER searches on the five metagenomes. This step aims to identify novel Rhs core-containing proteins in the metagenomic datasets.

Analysis of Results
1.1 Reference Genomes
Histogram of Hits: Plot the number of hits identified in each reference genome. This provides an overview of the abundance of Rhs core domains across different bacterial genomes.
Sequence Characteristics: Analyze the lengths, domain structures, and conservation patterns of the identified sequences. Highlight regions of interest that may differentiate toxins from structural Rhs proteins.
2.1 Metagenomes
Distribution of Hits: Compare the abundance of Rhs core hits across the five metagenomes. This can provide insights into environmental or host-associated variations.
Novel Candidates: Identify sequences that show significant matches to the combined Rhs-core-database profile but are not present in the reference genomes.
Use tools like BLASTP to annotate these sequences and determine if they are potentially novel toxins.
3.1 Visualization:
Phylogenetic Trees: Construct phylogenetic trees of the aligned sequences to infer evolutionary relationships among the Rhs proteins.
Domain Composition: Visualize domain architectures of candidate Rhs toxins to confirm the presence of conserved Rhs core regions and identify unique features.
4.1 Further Validation:
Functional Predictions: Use structural modeling tools such as AlphaFold to predict the 3D structures of selected candidates.
Verify their similarity to known Rhs toxins and assess functional relevance.
